# It's Me, Aritra! 🎮

Hi! I'm Aritra, an Electronics & Communication Engineering student who loves building things at the intersection of hardware and software. I work across web development, IoT, and AI/ML—using whatever tool gets the job done.

I code in C, Python, TypeScript and React.js, and I've built everything from web apps and dashboards to a Bluetooth RC car and ML-based prediction projects.

Currently focused on sharpening my web development skills while diving deeper into electronics. I'm actively learning machine learning and data structures, and I care about understanding *why* things work, not just making them work.

I'm always open to collaborating on open-source IoT or AI/ML projects with real social impact. If you're into robotics, system design, edge ML, or squeezing performance out of limited hardware—we'll probably get along!

⚡ **Fair warning:** when something genuinely interests me, I tend to hyper-focus and go all in.
